Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the user table.
* Javascript should prevent the pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note either plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to 
Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back a customer 
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
